Everything works, the loading of the images however should be done in GUI and those images should be used for the 
pictures that are needed in mainwindow and welcomescreen. I didnt have time to correct them ( everything started 
breaking so I just gave up).

The program doesnt run for levels with different dimensions. I still dont know why but I think it has to do with
allocation of the memory and drawing of the tiles. So if one level is (30,30) , another one has to be (30,30) as well for
this program to work
